The getSnacked web application offers access to a hub of food-related information. Users can log in via Facebook to discuss various topics, vote on content, get information on local restaurants, read feeds from popular culinary websites and communicate with other members via a messaging system. Links to outside content allow users to explore further ideas on informative websites they might not have known about. 

The MEAN.IO stack provides a platform for quick development and implementation of these goals. The stack is fast, responsive, easily scalable and uses a single programming language from top to bottom: JavaScript. Included integration with OAuth and Passport.js allows users to log in with pre-existing third-party applications and allows developers to skip the creation of complex authentication systems.

Built for the Software Engineering I module during my second year at NUIG.
